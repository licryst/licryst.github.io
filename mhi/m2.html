	 Total health spending in Canada is expected to reach $331 billion in 2022, or $8,563 per Canadian.Footnotei This follows a surge in spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in 2020.
In 2020, federal, provincial and territorial governments (combined) spent $770 per person on health-specific funding to deal with COVID-19. Pandemic response funding is projected to decline to $376 per person in 2022. 
Total health expenditure in 2022 is expected to rise by 0.8%, following high growth of 13.2% in 2020 and 7.6% in 2021. Prior to the pandemic, from 2015 to 2019, growth in health spending averaged 4% per year. It is anticipated that overall health expenditure will represent 12.2% of Canadaâ€™s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022, following a high of 13.8% in 2020.
Continued growth in spending is expected in 2022 as care that was deferred during the pandemic returns, resulting in an increase in the number of health care services provided compared with pre-pandemic years. In addition, demographic factors such as population aging and population growth will continue to contribute to spending growth.
